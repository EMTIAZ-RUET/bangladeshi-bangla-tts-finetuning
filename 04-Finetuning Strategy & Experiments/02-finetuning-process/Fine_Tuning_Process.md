# Fine-Tuning Process

The fine-tuning of the VITS-based Bangla TTS model was carried out in an **iterative and carefully monitored process** to ensure both **training stability** and **quality of generated audio outputs**. The procedure combined **progressive epoch training**, **loss curve monitoring**, and **qualitative audio evaluation** at each stage.

---

## 1. Training Schedule

The model was fine-tuned in **multiple stages** rather than a single long run to ensure optimal convergence and avoid training instabilities:

### **Progressive Training Stages**

* **Stage 1: Warm-up Phase (10 epochs)**
  - Initial adaptation to the hybrid Bangladeshi Bangla dataset
  - Gentle learning rate to prevent catastrophic forgetting
  - Focus on basic phoneme alignment and vocoder stability

* **Stage 2: Refinement Phase (50 epochs)**
  - Model begins to adapt to accent-specific features
  - Generator and discriminator balance establishment
  - Mel-spectrogram reconstruction improvement

* **Stage 3: Convergence Phase (50 epochs)**
  - Fine-grained pronunciation and prosody refinement
  - Reduction of artifacts and noise in generated audio
  - Enhanced naturalness and fluency

* **Stage 4: Final Stabilization (50 epochs)**
  - Final convergence towards optimal loss values
  - Accent fidelity consolidation
  - Quality consistency across diverse input texts

### **Training Strategy Benefits**

* **Checkpoint Preservation**: Updated weights saved at the end of each stage for next cycle initialization
* **Mode Collapse Prevention**: Progressive approach mitigated adversarial training instabilities
* **Gradual Adaptation**: Allowed model to incrementally adapt to hybrid dataset characteristics
* **Quality Control**: Regular evaluation checkpoints ensured consistent improvement

## 2. Monitoring & Logging

During training, comprehensive monitoring of both **quantitative metrics** and **qualitative outputs** was implemented to track model performance and identify potential issues early.

### **Loss Functions Tracked**

The VITS architecture employs multiple loss components, each serving a specific purpose in the training process:

* **Discriminator Loss (`avg_loss_disc`)**
  - Monitored adversarial learning balance
  - Ensured discriminator effectiveness without overpowering generator
  - Target: Stable convergence around 1.0-2.0 range

* **Generator Loss (`avg_loss_gen`)**
  - Tracked synthesis quality improvements over epochs
  - Indicated generator's ability to fool discriminator
  - Target: Gradual decrease with stabilization

* **KL Divergence Loss (`avg_loss_kl`)**
  - Monitored latent space regularization
  - Ensured proper probabilistic modeling of phonemes
  - Critical for maintaining diversity in generated outputs

* **Feature Matching Loss (`avg_loss_feat`)**
  - Encouraged stability and perceptual similarity
  - Reduced mode collapse risks in adversarial training
  - Enhanced naturalness through intermediate feature alignment

* **Mel-Spectrogram Loss (`avg_loss_mel`)**
  - **Most critical metric** for aligning generated audio with target spectrograms
  - Direct correlation with perceived audio quality
  - Primary indicator of accent adaptation success

* **Duration Loss (`avg_loss_duration`)**
  - Ensured accurate phoneme-to-frame alignment
  - Critical for proper speech timing and rhythm
  - Essential for maintaining prosodic naturalness

### **Sample Training Log Analysis**

Representative training metrics from a typical epoch during Stage 2:

```
Epoch: 25/50 | Batch: 150/200
| > avg_loss_disc: 2.65    # Discriminator learning effectively
| > avg_loss_gen: 2.05     # Generator competing successfully  
| > avg_loss_kl: 1.65      # Proper latent space regularization
| > avg_loss_feat: 6.18    # Feature matching convergence
| > avg_loss_mel: 15.65    # Mel-spectrogram alignment (primary focus)
| > avg_loss_duration: 1.52 # Accurate timing alignment

Learning Rate: 2e-4 | GPU Memory: 12.8GB/15GB | Time: 2.3s/batch
```

### **Trend Analysis Methodology**

* **Loss Convergence Tracking**: Monitored epoch-to-epoch trends for early convergence detection
* **Stability Assessment**: Identified oscillations or sudden spikes indicating training instability  
* **Comparative Analysis**: Compared metrics across training stages to validate progressive improvement
* **Early Stopping Criteria**: Established thresholds for intervention if losses plateaued or diverged

## 3. Audio Evaluation

Complementing quantitative loss monitoring, **human-in-the-loop evaluation** provided direct assessment of speech quality improvements throughout the training process.

### **Evaluation Methodology**

* **Sample Generation**: After each training stage, generated audio samples from standardized test sentences
* **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluated outputs against both original dataset samples and previous training stages
* **Multi-dimensional Assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation across multiple speech quality dimensions

## 5. Training Process Justification

The methodical approach employed in this fine-tuning process was designed to address specific challenges in TTS model adaptation while maximizing training effectiveness.
